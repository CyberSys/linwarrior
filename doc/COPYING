COPYING

The Project contains parts that may be re-distributed in part or whole under
As-it-is, CC-BY(-SA), CC-Sampling+, among others as specified independently.
For Licensing details see below.


Source-Code License

    As-it-is open source.

    By no way does that imply that the original code-base is generally
    governed under that license - but that what you have received is a
    version (re-)licensed under that very license.

    As a side note: The author is currently targeting towards mature
    users who understand that this software is under development -
    than in mass distribution to complaining users.

    The main author retains the right to publish other versions of the
    code-base under different licenses. These are basic rights
    expressed explicitly for those in doubt.

    In case you would like to use a fractional part of the source
    for your own project just rip it and use it - one can talk about how big
    fractional can get - a notification or reference would be appreciated.

    If you would like submit a patch a copyright-transfer would be necessary.

    This source is under benevolent dictatorship.
    If there are any questions, problems, suggestions
    please get into direct contact.
