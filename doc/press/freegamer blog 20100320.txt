You are right I have to work on communication.

I was shocked to read that you tried to get into contact several times. I am very happy when I receive email and I answer every email I can get - but I haven't received any emails lately about LinWarrior - I wonder wether they got eaten up by the spam-remover.

As for my email address, I have several forwards to my main address - one can be found on the game's "BBS"-page (just replace the # with an @) "devteam#hackcraft.de".
Another one can be found via a link at the bottom of the page "Service Provider".
I just checked them ok. I guess I have to have an on-page postbox.

If there is demand I can deploy an rss-feed.
A public mailing list or forum may come someday.
Guess I underestimated the demand.

I'm reading this page and Happypenguin, too.
There is an entry for LinWarrior on happypenguin.org you can leave comments there or start a thread in their forum.

Network-Gaming is not a near-time goal but it may come eventually. Actually I *would* like to implement split-screen-multiplayer right now but OpenAL (the 3d-audio api) doesn't support multiple listeners at the moment. I do have the strong feeling that "we" the open-source community should foster OpenAL-Standards-Development - see OpenAL-Soft. 
If there would be multilistener-support split-screen would be a no-brainer and imagine it on a >40" flatscreen.
But networking most probably wont come in before the gameplay is advanced enough and most features are fixed.
Anyway you are right: Many people would enjoy such a game in multiplayer mode and I'm not saying never.

Graphics are similar besides that up to the current release "models" where hardcoded opengl rendering code and not mesh-files - the next release will change it - it's already implemented but the release is still pending.
