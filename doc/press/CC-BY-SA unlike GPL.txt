In response to: http://www.opengameart.org/content/im-commercial-closed-source-game-developer-can-i-use-art

A word ahead: I'm not a closed game developer.
I have been doing some research to decide which license to use for content and I've read your opinion - so here is mine.

CC-BY-SA is not as virulent as GPL - which is a good thing because I would not include content (which may be exchanged) which would force a license on my code.

CC-BY-SA Derived work needs to be CC-BY-SA, too, yes, but the assembly and performance on a platform itself as a whole excluding the work does not need to be CC-BY-SA.

So CC-BY-SA protects my rights on the work itself and direct derivates thereof but makes no claim over incorporation into collections that are more than the sum of their parts (see CC-BY-SA: 1a Adaptation, 1b Collection).

The license does of course state that an un-intelligent/un-artistic collection of works is not enough - say dumb collection CDs - a collection not worthy of any copyright itself.

To quote bart: "These licenses allow you to use the licensed content freely, but you must distribute the entire work under a license that requires the content to be shared freely." (http://www.opengameart.org/content/explanation-licenses-allowed-opengameartorg)

A valid license could therefore say "Some code is license X but certain content is CC-BY-SA" (see CC-BY-SA: 4. Restrictions a)

This license contains a lot of common sense.
