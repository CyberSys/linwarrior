Your Keyboard is used to emulate a Gamepad, the keys are:

A,W for L1,L2
G,R for R1,R2

S for [] (square)
E for ^ (delta)
D for X (cross)
F for () (circle)

Arrow-Keys for A1 (Analoug Axis 1)
Komma "," for A1-Button

JIKL (like AWSD) for A2 (Analoug Axis 2)
Period "." for A2-Button

Alt-JIKL for Digital Coolie-Hat (or Digital Steering-Cross)


ASCII-Art of the Keyboard Layout (Monospaced Font):

 W/E\R   /I\
A/SDF\G /JKL\


Gamepads/Joysticks
------------------

A Gamepad can be used alongside the Keyboard-Mapping.

Saitek's Impact gamepad works ok, similar layed out gamepads or by
the same vendor may work, too (Z-Shaped ordering of the four buttons).
Generally logitek is working for linux quite well as I have heard.

Speed Link's Thunder-Strike axes were malfunctioning (SDL problem?).


Mech Controll Mapping (cMech.h)
-------------------------------

A1  Throttle and Steering
A2  Turret Body
[]  Jump-Jet
R2  Fire Next Weapon
^   Change Point of View (Internal,External,External-Far,Front,Satellite,Satellite-Far)
