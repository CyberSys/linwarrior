- The Topics TODOs need a evaluation and priorization pass
  [Note: Topics aren't ordered - individual TODOs approx top most next]


Inspector-/Edit-Mode:

- Provide command shell to provide tools

- Render Debug-Object-Information when Paused/Debug-Mode.

- Extend Pause/Debug-Mode to Simple Object-Placement Edit-Mode.


AI and behavior:

- Fix reaction to ai being fired at (state transitions in controller).

- Reintroduce some random walking pattern when in close range combat (or in line of sight).

- Think about blocked-left/-front/-right detectors for collision avoidance.

- Wingmen shall maintain minimum distance to each other (collision avoidance).
  [solvable by just avoiding the nearest unit at a time]

- AI Target-Visibility (LOS): Don't shoot when target is behind a wall.

- Waypoints and pathfinding? (works fine so far without)

- AI shall support allied Objects (attack their targets/attackers, learn their enemies, follow allies on demand).

- AI allies should pop follow command when leader is wrecked.


Refactoring and cleanup:

- Bind all mech's components properly

- Remove reliance on NaN for no destination (portability and fast-math problems).

- rGrouping shall be handled like other object components (use message method?).

- Player's jumpjet light shall be moved to a component.

- Convert visual/model objects (tree, planetmap, building, etc.) to components?

- Resolve HUD dependency on cMech-Class's weapons.

- Make weapon chaining work with weapon-bindings.

- Use vec4 to utilize vector ops?


Landscape:

- Take slope into account for Planetmap erosion and material within second pass.

- City-generator.

- Biome and continents - pre-designed shape and automatic fill out?

- Find a way to add Caves and sub-terrain to the Planetmap's height map (hole mod?).

- Add vegetation growth mods.

- Add water veins.

- Add oceans.


Immersion and FX:

- Implement camera lag and shake rig

- Camera shall not pass through ground (implement camera particle physics)

- Footstep sound

- Colored particles indicating damage inflicted (chipping off).

- Dust when walking


Gameplay:

- Select target ahead (button). Implement Target ahead selection in tarcom?

- Selected target should be identified (button/automatically-timed).

- Implement command scheme and gui for sending Wingmen Orders to group members

- Reload/Refill/Repair Zones.

- First real mission.

- Radar LOS and Disturbances?

- Turrets

- Weapon-Engage and -Disengage time. (necessary?)

- Portals


Formats and Files:

- OGG or FLAC loader instead of flat WAV?

- Decide on static object format(s). (same as rigged meshes? special ones?)

- Mission File Loading.


Materials and lighting:

- Someday with shaders: Shadowmapping for global sun/moon lightsource.

- Someday with shaders: Environment-Ambient-lighting according to the dome.

- Someday with shaders: Deferred lighting, necessary for multiple effect lights.
