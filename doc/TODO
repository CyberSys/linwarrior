- Add target and destination attributes to Mobile and bind them.

- Move object's do_*() functionality to Mobile and add bindings to Controller?

- Move object's in_*() functionality to Mobile and add bindings to Controller?

- Object's damageByParticle() shall be represented in components, too.

- Resolve HUD dependency on cMech-Class's weapons.

- Make weapon chaining work with weapon-bindings.

- Wingmen shall maintain minimum distance to each other (collision avoidance).

- Take slope into account for Planetmap erosion and material within second pass.

- Calculate Bounding-Box/Cylinder for rRigged meshes.

- Collision zone shall be determined by mesh's boundary size.

- Global lightsource-position shall be animated according to sun/moon.

- Render Debug-Object-Information when Paused/Debug-Mode.

- Extend Pause/Debug-Mode to Simple Object-Placement Edit-Mode.

- Select target ahead (button).

- Selected target should be identified (button/automatically-timed).

- Someday with shaders: Shadowmapping for global sun/moon lightsource.

- Someday with shaders: Environment-Ambient-lighting according to the dome.

- Maybe someday: Outsource Tools and generating from Simulator?
